## Why did I create this repository?

To help designers have a consistent starting point when creating responsive websites from scratch.

----

## What is in this repository?

A small collection of PSD template files. These files have guides and grid layers to define the grid with gutters for various breakpoints.

Designers usually use the Photoshop guides to to define other alignments in the document, after awhile, the guides can get muddy and deciphering was is for the grid and what is to align elements becomes harder. Because of this, there are two variations of each template file - one with and one without gutters. The template file without gutters means that the guides are intact and there isn't an additional color visual to highlight the gutters of the grid. The template file with gutters just means there is an addited color layer that highlights the gutters so that designers may move the guides freely without losing site of the grid.
